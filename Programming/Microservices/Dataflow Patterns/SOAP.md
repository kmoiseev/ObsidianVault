SOAP is an XML-based protocol for making network API requests. Although it is most commonly used over HTTP, it aims to be independent from HTTP and avoids using most HTTP features. Instead, it comes with a sprawling and complex multitude of related standards (the web service framework, known as WS-*) that add various features

The API of a SOAP web service is described using an XML-based language called the Web Services Description Language, or WSDL. WSDL enables code generation so that a client can access a remote service using local classes and method calls (which are encoded to XML messages and decoded again by the framework). This is useful in statically typed programming languages.

Even though SOAP and its various extensions are ostensibly standardized, interoperability between different vendorsâ€™ implementations often causes problems [39]. For all of these reasons, although SOAP is still used in many large enterprises, it has fallen out of favor in most smaller companies.
