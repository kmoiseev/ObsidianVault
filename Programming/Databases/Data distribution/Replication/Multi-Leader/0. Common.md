 It rarely makes sense to use a multi-leader setup within a single datacenter, because the benefits rarely outweigh the added complexity.
 
 ### Multi-datacenter
 
 In a multi-leader configuration, you can have a leader in each datacenter. Within each datacenter, regular leader–follower replication can be used; between datacenters, each datacenter’s leader replicates its changes to the leaders in other datacenters.

 Some databases support multi-leader configurations by default, but it is also often implemented with external tools, such as Tungsten Replicator for MySQL, BDR for PostgreSQL and GoldenGate for Oracle.
 
 Although multi-leader replication has advantages, it also has a big downside: the same data may be concurrently modified in two different datacenters, and those write conflicts must be resolved. Autoincrementing keys, triggers, and integrity constraints can be problematic. For this reason, multi-leader replication is often considered dangerous territory that should be avoided if possible
 
 ### Clients with offline operation
 
Another situation in which multi-leader replication is appropriate is if you have an application that needs to continue to work while it is disconnected from the internet.
 
In this case, every device has a local database that acts as a leader (it accepts write requests), and there is an asynchronous multi-leader replication process (sync) between the replicas of your calendar on all of your devices. The replication lag may be hours or even days, depending on when you have internet access available.

There are tools that aim to make this kind of multi-leader configuration easier. For example, CouchDB is designed for this mode of operation.

### Collaborative editing

Real-time collaborative editing applications allow several people to edit a document simultaneously. For example, Etherpad and Google Docs allow multiple people to concurrently edit a text document or spreadsheet.

When one user edits a document, the changes are instantly applied to their local replica (the state of the document in their web browser or client application) and asynchronously replicated to the server and any other users who are editing the same document.
