A *replication topology* describes the communication paths along which writes are propagated from one node to another. If you have two leaders there is only one plausible topology: leader 1 must send all of its writes to leader 2, and vice versa. With more than two leaders, various different topologies are possible.

The most general topology is all-to-all, in which every leader sends its writes to every other leader.

However, more restricted topologies are also used: for example, MySQL by default supports only a circular topology, in which each node receives writes from one node and forwards those writes (plus any writes of its own) to one other node.

Another popular topology has the shape of a star: one designated root node forwards writes to all of the other nodes. The star topology can be generalized to a tree.

In circular and star topologies, a write may need to pass through several nodes before it reaches all replicas. To prevent infinite replication loops, each node is given a unique identifier, and in the replication log, each write is tagged with the identifiers of all the nodes it has passed through.

A problem with circular and star topologies is that if just one node fails, it can interrupt the flow of replication messages between other nodes, causing them to be unable to communicate until the node is fixed.

On the other hand, all-to-all topologies can have issues too. In particular, some network links may be faster than others, with the result that some replication messages may “overtake” others

To order these events correctly, a technique called **version vectors** can be used
