The biggest problem with multi-leader replication is that write conflicts can occur, which means that conflict resolution is required.

For example, consider a wiki page that is simultaneously being edited by two users, as shown in. User 1 changes the title of the page from A to B, and user 2 changes the title from A to C at the same time. Each user’s change is successfully applied to their local leader. However, when the changes are asynchronously replicated, a conflict is detected

It is possible to make conflict detection synchronous - i.e. wait for the write to be replicated to all replicas before telling the user that the write was successful. However, by doing so, the main advantage of multi-leader replication is losed: allowing each replica to accept writes independently.

*The simplest strategy for dealing with conflicts is to avoid them*: if the application can ensure that all writes for a particular record go through the same leader, then conflicts cannot occur. Since many implementations of multi-leader replication handle conflicts quite poorly, avoiding conflicts is a frequently recommended approach.

### Convergent conflict resolution

The database must resolve conflicts in a *convergent* way, which means that *all replicas must arrive at the same final value when all changes have been replicated*.

Various ways of achieving convergent conflict resolution:

-   Give each write a unique ID (e.g., a timestamp, a long random number, a UUID, or a hash of the key and value), pick the write with the highest ID as the winner, and throw away the other writes. If a timestamp is used, this technique is known as **last write wins (LWW)**. Although this approach is popular, it is dangerously prone to data loss.

-   Give each replica a unique ID, and let writes that originated at a higher- numbered replica always take precedence over writes that originated at a lower- numbered replica. This approach also implies data loss.

-   Somehow merge the values together — e.g., order them alphabetically and then concatenate them

-   Record the conflict in an explicit data structure that preserves all information, and write application code that resolves the conflict at some later time (perhaps by prompting the user).

Most multi-leader replication tools let you write conflict resolution logic using appli‐ cation code. That code may be executed on write or on read:

*On write*

As soon as the database system detects a conflict in the log of replicated changes, it calls the conflict handler. For example, Bucardo allows you to write a snippet of Perl for this purpose. This handler typically cannot prompt a user—it runs in a background process and it must execute quickly.
 
*On read*
    
When a conflict is detected, all the conflicting writes are stored. The next time the data is read, these multiple versions of the data are returned to the applica‐ tion. The application may prompt the user or automatically resolve the conflict, and write the result back to the database. CouchDB works this way, for example.

Conflict resolution usually applies at the level of an individual row or document, not for an entire transaction.

### Automatic conflict resolution

Conflict resolution rules can quickly become complicated, and custom code can be error-prone. There has been some interesting research into automatically resolving conflicts caused by concurrent data modifications. A few lines of research are worth mentioning:

- *Conflict-free replicated datatypes* (CRDTs) are a family of data structures for sets, maps, ordered lists, counters, etc. that can be concurrently edited by multiple users, and which automatically resolve conflicts in sensible ways. Some CRDTs have been implemented in Riak 2.0

-  *Mergeable persistent data structures* track history explicitly, similarly to the Git version control system, and use a three-way merge function

-  *Operational transformation* is the conflict resolution algorithm behind collaborative editing applications such as Etherpad and Google Docs. It was designed particularly for concurrent editing of an ordered list of items, such as the list of characters that constitute a text document.
