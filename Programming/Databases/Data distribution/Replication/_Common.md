**Replication** means keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines that are connected via a network.

Reasons for replications:
- To keep data geographically close to users (+*latency*)
- To allow the system to continue working even if fail (+*avialability*)
- Scale out machines serving requests (+*throughput*)

*Single-leader* replication is popular because it is fairly easy to understand and there is no conflict resolution to worry about. *Multi-leader* and *leaderless* replication can be more robust in the presence of faulty nodes, network interruptions, and latency spikesâ€”at the cost of being harder to reason about and providing only very weak consistency guarantees.
