For workloads that consist of mostly reads and only a small percentage of writes (a common pattern on the web), there is an attractive option: create many followers, and distribute the read requests across those followers. This removes load from the leader and allows read requests to be served by nearby replicas.
 
In this *read-scaling* architecture, you can increase the capacity for serving read-only requests simply by adding more followers. However, this approach only realistically works with asynchronous replication — if you tried to synchronously replicate to all followers, a single node failure or network outage would make the entire system unavailable for writing.

Unfortunately, if an application reads from an asynchronous follower, it may see outdated information if the follower has fallen behind. This leads to apparent inconsistencies in the database: if you run the same query on the leader and a follower at the same time, you may get different results, because not all writes have been reflected in the follower. This inconsistency is just a temporary state—if you stop writing to the database and wait a while, the followers will eventually catch up and become consis‐ tent with the leader. For that reason, this effect is known as **eventual consistency**

In normal operation, the delay between a write happening on the leader and being reflected on a follower - the replication lag - may be only a fraction of a second, and not noticeable in practice. However, if the system is operating near capacity or if there is a problem in the network, the lag can easily increase to several seconds or even minutes. When the lag is so large, the inconsistencies it introduces are not just a theoretical issue but a real problem for applications.

##  Reading Your Own Writes

If the user views the data shortly after making a write, the new data may not yet have reached the replica.

In this situation, we need **read-after-write consistency**, also known as **read-your-writes consistency**

There are various techniques implementing read-after-write consistency:

-   When reading something that the user may have modified, read it from the leader; otherwise, read it from a follower. This requires that you have some way of knowing whether something might have been modified, without actually querying it. For example, user profile information on a social network is nor‐ mally only editable by the owner of the profile, not by anybody else. Thus, a sim‐ ple rule is: always read the user’s own profile from the leader, and any other users’ profiles from a follower.

-   System could track the time of the last update and, for one minute after the last update, make all reads from the leader. Application could also monitor the replication lag on followers and prevent queries on any follower that is more than one minute behind the leader.

-   The client can remember the timestamp of its most recent write - then the sys‐ tem can ensure that the replica serving any reads for that user reflects updates at least until that timestamp. If a replica is not sufficiently up to date, either the read can be handled by another replica or the query can wait until the replica has caught up. The timestamp could be a logical timestamp (something that indicates ordering of writes, such as the log sequence number) or the actual system clock.

-   If replicas are distributed across multiple datacenters (for geographical proximity to users or for availability), there is additional complexity. Any request that needs to be served by the leader must be routed to the datacenter that contains the leader.

 

##  Moving backward in time
 
This can happen if a user makes several reads from different replicas.

**Monotonic reads** is a guarantee that this kind of anomaly does not happen.
 One way of achieving monotonic reads is to make sure that each user always makes their reads from the same replica. For example, the replica can be chosen based on a hash of the user ID.
 
## Violation of causality

Preventing this kind of anomaly requires another type of guarantee: **consistent prefix reads**. This guarantee says that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.
