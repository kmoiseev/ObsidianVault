 Some data storage systems take a different approach, abandoning the concept of a leader and allowing any replica to directly accept writes from clients. Some of the earliest replicated data systems were leaderless, but the idea was mostly forgotten during the era of dominance of relational databases. It once again became a fashiona‚Äê ble architecture for databases after Amazon used it for its in-house(not avaiable outside of Amazon) Dynamo system. Riak, Cassandra, and Voldemort are open source datastores with leaderless replication models inspired by Dynamo, so this kind of database is also known as *Dynamo-style*.
