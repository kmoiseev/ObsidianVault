For example, Couchbase, Riak, and Voldemort generate a suggested partition assignment automatically, but require an administrator to commit it before it takes effect.

Fully automated rebalancing can be convenient, because there is less operational work to do for normal maintenance. However, it can be unpredictable. Rebalancing is an expensive operation, because it requires rerouting requests and moving a large amount of data from one node to another. If it is not done carefully, this process can overload the network or the nodes and harm the performance of other requests while the rebalancing is in progress. Such automation can be dangerous in combination with automatic failure detection.

For that reason, it can be a good thing to have a human in the loop for rebalancing. Itâ€™s slower than a fully automatic process, but it can help prevent operational surprises.
