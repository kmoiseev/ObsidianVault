Query all partitions and combine all the results returned. Considered to be quite expensive

Nevertheless, it is widely used: MongoDB, Riak, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, SolrCloud, and VoltDB - all use document-partitioned secondary indexes. Most database vendors recommend that you structure your partitioning scheme so that secondary index queries can be served from a single partition, but that is not always possible, especially when you’re using multiple secondary indexes in a single query

## Partitioning Secondary Indexes by Term (global indexes)
Rather than each partition having its own secondary index (a local index), we can construct a *global index* that covers data in all partitions. However, we can’t just store that index on one node, since it would likely become a bottleneck and defeat the purpose of partitioning. A global index must also be partitioned, but it can be partitioned differently from the primary key index.

We can partition the index by the term itself, or using a hash of the term. Partitioning by the term itself can be useful for range scans (e.g., on a numeric property, such as the asking price of the car), whereas partitioning on a hash of the term gives a more even distribution of load.

The advantage of a global (term-partitioned) index over a document-partitioned index is that it can make reads more efficient: rather than doing *scatter/gather* over all partitions, a client only needs to make a request to the partition containing the term that it wants. However, the downside of a global index is that writes are slower and more complicated, because a write to a single document may now affect multiple partitions of the index

In practice, updates to global secondary indexes are often asynchronous.
