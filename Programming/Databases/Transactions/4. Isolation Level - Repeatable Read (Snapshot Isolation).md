Problem that may happen with read committed isolation level

Called **Non-repeatable read** or **Read skew**

When these problems are unacceptable:

*Backups*
Taking a backup requires making a copy of the entire database, which may take hours on a large database. During the time that the backup process is running, writes will continue to be made to the database. Thus, you could end up with some parts of the backup containing an older version of the data, and other parts containing a newer version. If you need to restore from such a backup, the inconsistencies (such as disappearing money) become permanent.

*Analytic queries and integrity checks*
Sometimes, you may want to run a query that scans over large parts of the data‐ base. Such queries are common in analytics, or may be part of a periodic integrity check that everything is in order (monitoring for data corruption). These queries are likely to return nonsensical results if they observe parts of the database at different points in time.

*Snapshot isolation* is the most common solution to this problem. The idea is that each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database—that is, the transaction sees all the data that was committed in the database at the start of the transaction. Even if the data is subsequently changed by another transaction, each transaction sees only the old data from that particular point in time.

When a transaction can see a consistent snapshot of the database, frozen at a particular point in time, it is much easier to understand.

Snapshot isolation is a popular feature: it is supported by PostgreSQL, MySQL with the InnoDB storage engine, Oracle, SQL Server, and others.

# Implementation

Like read committed isolation, implementations of snapshot isolation typically use write locks to prevent dirty writes, which means that a transaction that makes a write can block the progress of another transaction that writes to the same object.

However, reads do not require any locks. From a performance point of view, a key principle of snapshot isolation is readers never block writers, and writers never block readers. This allows a database to handle long-running read queries on a consistent snapshot at the same time as processing writes normally, without any lock contention between the two.

The database must potentially keep several different committed versions of an object, because various in-progress trans‐ actions may need to see the state of the database at different points in time. Because it maintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as *multi-version concurrency control* - **MVCC**.

A typical approach is that read committed uses a separate snapshot for each query, while snapshot isolation uses the same snapshot for an entire transaction.

Each row in a table has a *created_by* field, containing the ID of the transaction that inserted this row into the table. Moreover, each row has a *deleted_by* field, which is initially empty. If a transaction deletes a row, the row isn’t actually deleted from the database, but it is marked for deletion by setting the *deleted_by* field to the ID of the transaction that requested the deletion. At some later time, when it is certain that no transaction can any longer access the deleted data, a garbage collection process in the database removes any rows marked for deletion and frees their space. An update is internally translated into a delete and a create.

When a transaction reads from the database, transaction IDs are used to decide which objects it can see and which are invisible.

Common algo is the following:

1. At the start of each transaction, the database makes a list of all the other transactions that are in progress (not yet committed or aborted) at that time. Any writes that those transactions have made are ignored, even if the transactions subsequently commit.
2. Any writes made by aborted transactions are ignored.
3. Any writes made by transactions with a later transaction ID (i.e., which started after the current transaction started) are ignored, regardless of whether those transactions have committed.
4. All other writes are visible to the application’s queries.

 

Put another way, an object is visible if both of the following conditions are true:
-   At the time when the reader’s transaction started, the transaction that created the object had already committed.
-   The object is not marked for deletion, or if it is, the transaction that requested deletion had not yet committed at the time when the reader’s transaction started.


**How indexing works with snapshots**

One option is to have the index simply point to all versions of an object and require an index query to filter out any object versions that are not visible to the current transaction. When garbage collec‐ tion removes old object versions that are no longer visible to any transaction, the cor‐ responding index entries can also be removed.

In practice, many implementation details determine the performance of multiversion concurrency control. For example, PostgreSQL has optimizations for avoiding index updates if different versions of the same object can fit on the same page.

With append-only B-trees, every write transaction (or batch of transactions) creates a new B-tree root, and a particular root is a consistent snapshot of the database at the point in time when it was created. There is no need to filter out objects based on transaction IDs because subsequent writes cannot modify an existing B-tree; they can only create new tree roots. However, this approach also requires a background process for compaction and garbage collection.

Snapshot isolation is a useful isolation level, especially for read-only transactions. However, many databases that implement it call it by different names. In Oracle it is called **serializable**, and in PostgreSQL and MySQL it is called **repeatable read**
