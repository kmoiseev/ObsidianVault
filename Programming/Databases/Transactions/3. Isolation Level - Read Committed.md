## Read committed
  
  It is the default setting in Oracle 11g, PostgreSQL, SQL Server 2012, MemSQL, and many other databases

#### Guarantees

---

When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed (*no dirty reads*).

*Dirty read example*

| Transaction 1 | Transaction 2 |
| -- | -- |
| SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;` | |
|| `UPDATE users SET age = 21 WHERE id = 1;`|
| `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;`||
||`ROLLBACK;`|

Second select from the example reads data from a transaction which will be rolled back.

---

When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been com‐ mitted (*no dirty writes*).

#### Implementation
**Preventing dirty writes**
Most commonly, databases prevent dirty writes by using row-level locks: when a transaction wants to modify a particular object (row or document), it must first acquire a lock on that object. It must then hold that lock until the transaction is committed or aborted. Only one transaction can hold the lock for any given object; if another transaction wants to write to the same object, it must wait until the first transaction is committed or aborted before it can acquire the lock and continue. This locking is done automatically by databases in read committed mode (or stronger isolation levels).

**Preventing dirty reads**
One option to prevent dirty reads would be to use the same lock, and to require any transaction that wants to read an object to briefly acquire the lock and then release it again immediately after reading. This would ensure that a read couldn’t happen while an object has a dirty, uncommitted value (because during that time the lock would be held by the transaction that has made the write).  

However, the approach of requiring read locks does not work well in practice, because one long-running write transaction can force many read-only transactions to wait until the long-running transaction has completed. This harms the response time of read-only transactions and is bad for operability: a slowdown in one part of an application can have a knock-on effect in a completely different part of the application, due to waiting for locks.
 
 For that reason, most databases prevent dirty reads using the following approach: for every object that is written, the database remembers both the old committed value and the new value set by the transaction that currently holds the write lock. While the transaction is ongoing, any other transactions that read the object are simply given the old value. Only when the new value is committed do transactions switch over to reading the new value.

# Read phenomenons

 
 ### Non - repeatable reads
 
 The problem happens when during a single transaction results of a read are different because of the changes committed by another transaction.
 
 | Transaction 1 | Transaction 2 |
| -- | -- |
| `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;` | |
|| `UPDATE users SET age = 21 WHERE id = 1;`<br/>`COMMIT;`|
| `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;`<br/>`COMMIT;`||

 In this example, Transaction 2 commits successfully, which means that its changes to the row with id 1 should become visible. However, Transaction 1 has already seen a different value for `age` in that row.
 
 ### Phantoms
 
 Similar to *not - repeatable reads*, but related to multiple rows. A _phantom read_ occurs when, in the course of a transaction, new rows are added or removed by another transaction to the records being read.

 | Transaction 1 | Transaction 2 |
| -- | -- |
| `SELECT * FROM users`<br/>`WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 30;` ||
|| `INSERT INTO users(id, name, age)`<br/>` VALUES (3, 'Bob', 27);`<br/>`COMMIT;`|
| `SELECT * FROM users`<br/>`WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 30;`<br/>`COMMIT;`||

# Isolation levels

### Read uncommitted
**Lowest isolation level**. 
Dirty reads are allowed, so one transaction may see not-yet committed changes made by other transactions.

### Read Committed
 DBMS implementation keeps write locks (acquired on selected data) until the end of the transaction, but read locks are released as soon as the `SELECT` operation is performed. 
 Some realizations of this isolation level use versioning. In this case a transaction which changes the data is working with its own database snaphoot that is invisible to others.

### Repeatable Read
DBMS implementation keeps read and write locks (acquired on selected data) until the end of the transaction.

### Serializable
**Highest isolation level.** 
DBMS implementation keeps range-locks in addition to read/write locks.
The execution of concurrent SQL-transactions at isolation level SERIALIZABLE is guaranteed to be serializable. A serializable execution is defined to be an execution of the operations of concurrently executing SQL-transactions that produces the same effect as some serial execution of those same SQL-transactions. A serial execution is one in which each SQL-transaction executes to completion before the next SQL-transaction begins
