Lost update - quite a common example of concurrency problem in a database
![[DB_Transaction_Isolation_lost_update.png]]
Examples:
-   Incrementing a counter or updating an account balance (requires reading the current value, calculating the new value, and writing back the updated value)
-   Making a local change to a complex value, e.g., adding an element to a list within a JSON document
-   Two users editing a wiki page at the same time, where each user saves their changes by sending the entire page contents to the server, overwriting whatever is currently in the database

## Solutions

#### Atomic write operations

Many databases provide atomic update operations, which remove the need to implement read-modify-write cycles in application code.
```sql
UPDATE counters SET value = value + 1 WHERE key = 'foo';
```

Similarly, document databases such as MongoDB provide atomic operations for making local modifications to a part of a JSON document, and Redis provides atomic operations for modifying data structures such as priority queues.  

*In situations where atomic operations can be used, they are usually the best choice.*

#### Explicit locking
If atomic update is not possible, application can explicitly lock objects that are going to be updated. Then the application can perform a read-modify-write cycle, and if any other transaction tries to concurrently read the same object, it is forced to wait until the first read-modify-write cycle has completed.
