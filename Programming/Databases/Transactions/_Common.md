Almost all relational databases today, and some nonrelational databases, support transactions. Although some implementation details have changed, the general idea has remained virtually the same for 40 years. In the late 2000s, nonrelational (NoSQL) databases started gaining popularity. They aimed to improve upon the relational status quo by offering a choice of new data models, and by including replication and partitioning by default. Transactions were the main casualty of this movement: many of this new generation of databases abandoned transactions entirely, or redefined the word to describe a much weaker set of guarantees than had previously been understood.
